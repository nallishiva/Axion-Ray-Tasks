# AxionRay Assignment – Data Analysis & Tagging

This repository contains my solution for the AxionRay Data Analyst assignment, covering **Task 1 (Data Tagging)** and **Task 2 (Data Analysis and Insights Generation)**.

## 🧩 Task 1: Data Tagging

Task 1 focused on converting unstructured service data into structured categories using a predefined taxonomy.

### Approach
- Analyzed complaint, cause, and correction fields
- Tagged records using only approved taxonomy values
- Used data validation to ensure consistency and avoid new labels
- Applied closest-match logic where exact terms were unavailable

### Outputs
- Tagged dataset (Excel)
- Summary report explaining tagging logic and insights

## 📊 Task 2: Data Analysis & Insights

Task 2 focused on understanding the dataset, cleaning the data, generating insights, and extracting meaningful tags from free-text fields.

### Key Steps
- Performed column-wise analysis (data types, distributions, significance)
- Cleaned data by handling missing values, standardizing text, and validating numeric fields
- Created visualizations (bar and line charts) to highlight key patterns
- Generated tags from free text to capture failure conditions, components, and repair actions

### Key Insights
- Leak- and sensor-related issues occur frequently
- A small number of components contribute to most failures
- Most repairs involve replacement or tightening, indicating installation or early-life quality issues

## 📁 Repository Contents
- Cleaned and tagged datasets (Excel)
- Python scripts used for analysis and visualization
- Summary reports for Task 1 and Task 2

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to structure unorganized data, apply exploratory analysis, generate actionable insights, and present results clearly for stakeholders.
